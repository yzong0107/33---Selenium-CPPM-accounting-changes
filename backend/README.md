# Install the program

1. Install [Miniconda (Python)](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)  on your local machine. You can access conda via the console, to make sure it's properly installed please run `conda -V` to display the version, and run `python -V` to display the version.

2. Create new virtual environment. Open Anaconda Prompt and run (taken an example of python 3.10):

    ```conda create --name selenium_env python==3.12 â€“y```

3.  Once it's created you can activate it by running: ```conda activate selenium_env```

4. Go to the current directory, run ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` under the activated virtual environment

5. Setup environment variables for Windows System. Typical path is :C:\Users\user_ID\AppData\Local\Continuum\miniconda3\envs\selenium_env

6. To show hidden files in Windows OS:

2. Fill in the AiM login username and password in the command line window, note that the password won't be shown on the screen. Click enter and the program will continue.

3. template excel file should always starts with "template" and ends with "xlsx", e.g. template339.xlsx
4. template excel file should be saved in "input" file, and will be moved to "archived" folder once processed.
5. Input folder should only have 1 excel file
